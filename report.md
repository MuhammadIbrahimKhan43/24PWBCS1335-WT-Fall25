# Lab 01 Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to create and manage files in a Git repository.  
I practiced committing changes, deleting files, and using branches for experiments.  
I also created a .gitignore and LICENSE file and learned how they affect the repository.  
Merging branches taught me how to combine experimental work into the main project.  
Overall, this lab helped me understand the basics of Git version control.
